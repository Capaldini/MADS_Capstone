      "I mentioned to you that we're going to do some biweekly stand-ups, so here's what to do in a stand-up. Some of you who might have worked at tech companies or similar organizations might already know about them, but if you're new, here is roughly what we're going to do. When it comes time for your stand-up, you're going to get on your webcam, or your screen recording tool, doesn't matter.Z You can show your face or not, and you're going to answer the following questions. What did my team work on this past week? What are we working on now? What issues are blocking us? Even if you're not especially blocked by anything, just say what are some of the challenges that you're facing or things that you're not sure of. To emphasize here, any team member can make the recording, so it doesn't have to be everybody on the team. I just want one representative from the team to make the stand-up and feel free to use your screen-sharing to show us any code snippets or cool results. It can be quite casual, this is not a presentation, this is a check-in. If you're facing something that is little difficult or incomplete, then that actually could be good for your classmates to see. They might have an opinion on it or a suggestion or it might just make somebody else who's dealing with that feel a little bit better, so please don't be afraid to be a little bit authentic here about what you're dealing with. One more thing, there are no hard limits on time, but the ideal would be about three to five minutes. If you go over, that's fine, if you go under, that can also be okay. We're not enforcing any limits, I just want you to do the exercise and help us understand what you were working on. Finally, let me tell you how to share your stand-up. What you're gonna do is upload your video to your U-M google Drive. You could also upload it to a personal YouTube channel or another video hosting service. It doesn't really matter as long as it's somewhere that you can upload the video and share a link to it. There is limited storage space on Slack, so please don't directly upload your video to Slack. Upload the video and then you're going to go in the stand-ups channel and copy and paste a link to the recording and make sure permissions are set so your classmates can view it. In the message body, please write your team name and then stand up. The team name is going to be the unique names of your teammates in alphabetical order. Unique names is just your University of Michigan email address. For example, it would be Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, stand up, and that's it. Then I will be asking you to watch and comment on two other classmates stand-ups, one stand up per team every two weeks, don't worry, I will remind you when they are coming, you will not be in the dark about this, and I can also create, you know, I'll put one in the channel, a demo, so you can see a real one. Stand-ups are a really popular way that a lot of organizations help their members stay responsible for their work, stay on task, motivate one another, and just build a sense of community. It's just really cool to get to see what you're working on and to watch your project and other people's unfold over time. I am looking forward to seeing you in the stand-up channel.\n"
